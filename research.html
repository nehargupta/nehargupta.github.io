									<h2>USA Low-Income Housing (public housing and vouchers)</h2>
This project started in Spring of 2019, in Duke's Economics 605, Advanced Microeconomics, advised by Dr. Charlie Becker. It is an ongoing
project. I am excited to start working with local public housing authorities, to start gathering data and exploring applications.
I also plan to adjust my model to address eviction risks, as this is a relevant topic in these COVID timems.
<p><p>
Abstract: Low-income households looking for federally funded housing benefits in the US are eligible for one of two options. 
One is public housing, which would place them in a unit that is maintained and owned by the government. 
The second is a housing voucher, which would provide them with payments toward rent of a privately owned complex. 
Households have heterogeneous preferences on housing options. They also can fail to find a house using a voucher, 
after investing search costs. Due to a severe supply limitation, local authorities, who distribute vouchers and public housing units, 
maintain waitlists for eligible households. I discuss the importance of a joint mechanism distributing access to the two programs, 
and discuss issues in existing public housing allocation mechanisms that neglect voucher programs. I define desirable properties 
of a joint mechanism, propose three possible mechanisms, and simulate these to illustrate impact on the utility of agents. 
These simulations are policy-relevant, as jurisdictions consider imposing supply shocks to the amount of available public 
housing complexes, or consider regulations aiming to protect voucher-holders against discrimination when searching for rentals.

									<h2>Causal Inference Work</h2>
									<p>
									I am the primary author of an open-source package for two algorithms, DAME and FLAME, 
									for high-accuracy matching of treatment-control groups for causal inference. I wrote a 
									20+ page documentation featuring visualizations, examples, and simulations. I also provide comparisons between DAME-FLAME and other common matching algorithms or packages, such as R-MatchIt, R-CEM, and Generalized Causal Forests. 
The work is available here: <a href="https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/DAME-FLAME-Python-Package/">https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/DAME-FLAME-Python-Package/</a>.
									I am the first author (meaning had the most contributions) on a paper about this, currently undergoing review.

									<p>
									I spend time consulting and advising applied researchers and tech industry engineers interested in using this algorithm in their research. 
									I'm happy to consult on design of research studies, and expand the code for researchers as needed.
									<p>
									
									My ongoing work is in applied labor economics program evaluation studies, while incorporating my algorithms in the analysis. It's a good method 
									for situations where there is granularity in heterogeneous outcomes on treatment.

										<h1>Older Papers/Course Projects</h1>
									</header>
									A summary of some older works that I might one day return to. 
									<p>
									<h3>Household Income Research</h3>
									From May 2019 - May 2020, advised by Dr. Pat Bayer.
Explored intergenerational mobility by ethnic group, using metrics such as education and income outcomes, by running regressions on NLSY data. Then, in an extension of the work, “Divergent Paths: A New Perspective on Earnings Differences Between Black and White Men Since 1940” (Bayer, Charles), I used quantile regressions to examine the evolution of earnings differences between black, white, and Hispanic women. Using IPUMS data, I compared percentile rankings in black, white, and Hispanic female earnings distributions. To account for the growing female labor force 
<p>
									

									<h3>Economic Growth, Technical Changes and Wage Gaps</h3>
									From Aug 2019 - May 2020, Advised by Dr. Pietro Peretto. 
									Explored literature on existing and historic gender wage differentials and the influence of occupational choice. Surveyed economic growth research, emphasizing the work of Daron Acemoglu, predicting the impact of “skill-biased” technical changes, due to the growth of automation technology. Predicted the impact of skill-biased technical change on gender wage differentials, based on varying gender participation trends in high, medium, and low-tech sectors.  
									<p>

									<h3>Bug Bounty Program Incentives</h3>
									<p>From September 2018 - Dec 2018.
										Advised by Dr. Vince Conitzer, working with Elizabeth Margolin (Facebook Privacy), and Alex Marsh (UNC Economics PhD Student). 
										Estimated hackers’ incentives to sell security vulnerabilities based on their market perception. Built domain expertise in the marketplace of zero-day exploits on dark web economies. Explored impact to corporations, including features and products forced to change, and estimated cost to firms. </p>

									<h3> GDPR and Data Privacy Regulations </h3>
										From Jan 2019 - May 2019. Advised by Dr. Bruce Maggs, working with Rachel Draelos (Duke MD/CS PhD) and Hyoung-Yoon Kim (Blockchain Industry Researcher). 
										Reported on upcoming trends in data privacy legislations, based on recent legislative successors. Explored impact to corporations, including features and products forced to change, and estimated the cost of these regulations to firms.
									<p>

									<h3>The Affordable Care Act and Internet Behavior </h3>
									From Jan 2016 - May 2016. Undergrad Economics Thesis at Michigan State University, advised by Dr. Jeff Biddle.
Senior Econ thesis on enrollment of Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) and its state level implementations. Used social media sentiment analysis, to incorporate the effect of frustration about website failures, on enrollment over time.
